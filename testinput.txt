And why wouldn't we suspect that the scammers would be tapping into all the buzz about the latest round of stimulus cash? 

Now, the Federal Trade Commission is warning us to be on the lookout for stimulus-related emails that supposedly are being sent by Joseph Simons, the FTC chairman who announced Tuesday that he plans to resign effective Jan. 29.

During the past year, about 324,000 reports relating to COVID-19 and stimulus-related scams and ripoffs have been made to the FTC through Jan. 18. Consumers reported losing $307 million to fraud that plays up the pandemic. 

The latest coronavirus relief scam involves emails that are designed to look like they're coming from an official government agency, and Simons specifically.

Joe Simons isn't emailing you; it's a scam.
